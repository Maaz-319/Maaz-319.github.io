## 🤖 AI & Game Development
This game is a result of combining human creativity with AI-generated logic. It showcases how AI can assist in coding, debugging, and optimizing game mechanics, making game development faster and more efficient.

## Features

**Parallax Background:**
A star field is generated and updated every frame to create depth.

**Screen Shake:**
When explosions occur, a shake timer is set and a random offset is applied to the canvas.

**Slow-Motion Power-Up:**
Picking up a blue “timeSlow” power-up sets a slower game pace temporarily.

**Drone Helpers:**
A “drone” power-up spawns helper drones that follow the player and shoot extra projectiles.

**Combo Multiplier & Achievements:**
Consecutive enemy kills increase your combo multiplier, boosting score rewards. Achievements (e.g., scoring 100 points or achieving a high combo) trigger on-screen notifications.

**Cool Visuals:**
Additional particle effects, thruster trails, and detailed drawing of entities create a super polished look.

**Multiple Attack Types:**
The player can switch between three weapons (laser, spread shot, charged blast) using keys 1–3. The spacebar fires projectiles based on the selected weapon.

**Varied Enemies:** In addition to standard enemies, “AdvancedEnemy” (with a curvy movement) and “BossEnemy” (a larger foe with health and a health bar) are added.

**Obstacles:** Meteors fall with rotation, and Gamma Rays (horizontal hazard beams) appear periodically.

**Power-Ups:** Randomly spawned power-ups provide health, temporary shields, or cycle the player’s weapon.
Dynamic Difficulty: A global difficulty variable increases over time to speed up spawn rates and enemy movements.
